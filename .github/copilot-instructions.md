# LastApple Music Station Generator

LastApple is a .NET 8.0 web application with React TypeScript frontend that creates personalized music stations by integrating Apple Music API and Last.fm API. The application generates playlists based on artist similarity, user listening history, and music tags.

Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Working Effectively

### Prerequisites and Environment Setup
- Install .NET 8.0 SDK from Microsoft's official site
- Install Node.js v18.x or higher: `node --version` should return v18+
- Ensure npm is available: `npm --version`

### Build Process (CRITICAL TIMING INFORMATION)
**AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENT**: This repository requires GitHub Packages authentication for the private `Inflatable.Lastfm` package (version 1.3.0-auth).

#### With GitHub Packages Access:
- Configure NuGet source with authentication: `dotnet nuget add source --username [username] --password [PAT] --store-password-in-clear-text --name github "https://nuget.pkg.github.com/kapral/index.json"`
- Restore packages: `dotnet restore` -- takes 2-3 minutes for private packages. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 5+ minutes.
- Build solution: `dotnet build --configuration Release` -- takes 10-15 seconds per project. NEVER CANCEL.
- Run .NET tests: `dotnet test` -- timing depends on MongoDB/API availability. Set timeout to 5+ minutes.

#### Without GitHub Packages Access:
- .NET restore and build will FAIL due to missing `Inflatable.Lastfm` v1.3.0-auth package
- Only AppleMusicApi project can be built independently: `dotnet build AppleMusicApi/AppleMusicApi.csproj --configuration Release` -- takes 8-10 seconds
- Document this limitation in any build issues encountered

### Frontend Development
- Install packages: `cd LastApple.Web/ClientApp && npm ci` -- takes 3-5 minutes. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 10+ minutes.
- Development server: `npm start` -- starts on port 3000, takes 30-60 seconds to compile
- Production build: `npm run build` -- takes 10-15 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 5+ minutes.
- Frontend tests: `npm run test -- --coverage --watchAll=false` -- FAILS due to missing MusicKit global, expected behavior

### Application Runtime Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Full application requires these secrets configured in appsettings.json:
- Apple Music API credentials (PrivateKey, KeyId, TeamId)
- Last.fm API credentials (ApiKey, Secret) 
- MongoDB connection string

**Without full configuration**:
- Frontend builds and starts successfully but API calls will fail
- Individual components can be developed and tested
- Use mock data for development when APIs are unavailable

## Validation and Testing

### Build Validation Steps
1. ALWAYS verify .NET 8.0 is available: `dotnet --version`
2. ALWAYS verify Node.js 18+: `node --version`
3. ALWAYS build individual projects first to isolate dependency issues
4. ALWAYS run frontend build to ensure React compilation works

### Manual Testing Scenarios
**Frontend Testing** (without backend):
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 after `npm start`
- Verify React application loads (will show authentication warnings)
- Check browser console for expected Apple Music/Last.fm authentication errors
- Test responsive design and basic navigation

**Backend Testing** (requires full API configuration):
- Start web application: `dotnet run --project LastApple.Web`
- Test API endpoints: /api/station, /api/apple-auth, /api/lastfm-auth
- Verify SignalR hub connections for real-time playlist updates
- Test complete music station generation workflow

### Known Limitations
- React tests fail due to missing MusicKit global object -- this is expected
- Build requires private GitHub packages for Last.fm integration
- Full functionality requires Apple Developer account and Last.fm API credentials
- MongoDB required for session persistence

## Project Structure and Navigation

### Key Projects
- **LastApple.Web**: Main ASP.NET Core web application with React frontend in `ClientApp/`
- **LastApple**: Core business logic for station generation and music services
- **AppleMusicApi**: Apple Music API integration and authentication
- **LastApple.Persistence**: MongoDB data persistence layer
- **LastApple.Tests**: NUnit test suite for business logic

### Important Files and Locations
- **Frontend entry**: `LastApple.Web/ClientApp/src/App.tsx`
- **API controllers**: `LastApple.Web/Controllers/`
- **React components**: `LastApple.Web/ClientApp/src/components/`
- **Station generation**: `LastApple/PlaylistGeneration/`
- **Configuration**: `LastApple.Web/appsettings.json` (uses token replacement)
- **Dependencies**: `LastApple.Web/ClientApp/package.json`, `*.csproj` files

### Frequently Modified Areas
- After changing station generation logic in `LastApple/PlaylistGeneration/`, ALWAYS test with `LastApple.Tests/StationGeneration/` tests
- After modifying Apple Music integration in `AppleMusicApi/`, verify authentication flow in frontend
- After updating React components, ALWAYS run `npm run build` to check for TypeScript compilation errors
- Before committing, ALWAYS run available linting: check if `.eslintrc.json` rules pass

## CI/CD Pipeline
The repository uses GitHub Actions with these workflows:
- **build-pullrequests.yml**: Runs on PRs to main branch
- **build-branch.yml**: Runs on all other branch pushes  
- **release-master.yml**: Deploys to Azure when pushing to main

**Pipeline Requirements**:
- Requires `GH_TOKEN` secret for GitHub Packages access
- Requires Apple Music API secrets for production deployment
- Requires Azure publish profile for deployment

## Common Commands Reference

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Full setup (with GitHub packages access)
dotnet restore
cd LastApple.Web/ClientApp && npm ci
cd ../.. && dotnet build --configuration Release
cd LastApple.Web/ClientApp && npm run build

# Frontend only development
cd LastApple.Web/ClientApp
npm ci
npm start  # Development server
npm run build  # Production build

# Individual project testing
dotnet build AppleMusicApi/AppleMusicApi.csproj  # Always works
dotnet test LastApple.Tests/  # Requires full dependencies
```

### Troubleshooting
- **NuGet restore fails**: Check GitHub Packages authentication or remove github source temporarily
- **Frontend build fails**: Verify Node.js version and run `npm ci` to clean install
- **Tests fail with MusicKit errors**: Expected behavior for frontend tests
- **API errors in browser**: Expected without proper Apple Music/Last.fm configuration

## Time Expectations (NEVER CANCEL)
- **npm ci**: 3-5 minutes, set timeout to 10+ minutes
- **npm run build**: 10-15 seconds, set timeout to 5+ minutes  
- **dotnet restore**: 2-3 minutes with GitHub packages, set timeout to 5+ minutes
- **dotnet build**: 10-15 seconds per project, set timeout to 5+ minutes
- **dotnet test**: Variable based on external dependencies, set timeout to 10+ minutes

ALWAYS wait for builds and tests to complete. Build cancellation leads to incomplete state and requires clean rebuilds.
